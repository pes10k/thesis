\section{Web API Standardization and Growth}
\label{background:webapi-growth}

The modern \WAPI is the result of many years of growth and standardization.
This standardization is intended to ensure that each browser's implementation
of the \WAPI is compatible, and that a web application will run equally
well in all modern browsers.

This standardizations process grew out of frustrations and incompatibilities
in earlier web browsers.  The two early major browsers, Netscape's ``Netscape
Navigator'' and Microsoft's ``Internet Explorer'' initially provided web sites
with completely different models for how to build interactive websites.  These
models differed in ways that were both trivial
(e.g. different names for properties and methods that provided identical
functionaltiy) and more fundametal (e.g. inverse event delegation models).

To try and keep the browsers' \gls{api}~s from drifting further apart, and
to try and make the web a more appealing application platform for developers,
the tasks of standardizing and growing the \WAPI was moved from the browser
vendors to standards organizations.  The two most signifigant organizations
are the \gls{w3c}, which oversaw the original web standards, and is the
main body overseeing the development of new \WAPI standards, and the
\gls{whatwg}, which was formed as a response to what was seen as slow
progress in the \gls{w3c}.  Other groups, such as the Kronos Group and
\gls{ecma}, manage relevant standards too (the
\textit{WebGL}~\cite{webgl2015standard} and \textit{\JS}~\cite{ecmascript}
standards, respectivly).
