\section{Introduction}
\label{future-web:introduction}

A fourth step this work makes in improving web privacy and security is to explore
other ways web-like applications could be developed and deployed, in light of
the findings discussed earlier in earlier chapters. Â While Chapter~\ref{current-web}
presented ways of improving web security and privacy while having to maintain
compatibility with existing websites, this chapter considers the further
improvements that could be achieved by a system designed from the start to
protect web users.

This chapter presents \CDF, an alternative method for describing interactive
websites. The design requires site authors to describe sites using a declarative,
statically checkable format, that trades a loss in author-expressiveness for
a gain in client-enforceable security guarantees.  The design is intended to
serve as a proof of concept that a hypermedia based communication medium with a
generic design can provide the features necessary
for a large subset of the popular uses of today's web, without the security
and privacy risks posed by the web's current \JS-based design.
The design is further intended to show that most of the functionality
users expect in modern websites can be implemented without needing to allow
websites to access the high-risk parts of the \WAPI, as identified in
Chapter~\ref{cost-benefit}.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: Section~\ref{future-web:design}
presents the high level design of the system, and Section~\ref{future-web:implementation}
describes how we implemented that design in a way that leverages the engineering
and omnipresence of commodity web browsers.  Section~\ref{future-web:evaluation}
gives an evaluation of the capabilities and security guarantees provided by the
system, and Section~\ref{future-web:implementation} discusses the limitations
of the current design, and the types of applications the design would not be
able to deliver.  Section~\ref{future-web:conclusions} discusses
this work's place in the context of the larger goals of this work.
