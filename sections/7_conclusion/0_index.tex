\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

The modern web is the result of a long series of largely uncoordinated iterative
changes, driven by a combination of lineage\footnote{e.g. the
adoption of Hypercard's event model in the early DOM standards.}, market
competition\footnote{e.g. the 10-day design and implementation cycle allowed
for the development of \JS}, well-intentioned but incorrect efforts to predict
where the web would go\footnote{e.g. the entire SVG \WAPI standard, intended
to compete with Flash's vector graphics system, but which never received
traction}, the inability or refusal of standards committees to work together
for the benefit of system cohesion\footnote{e.g. the choice of the CSS committee
to use kebab-case for style properties, v.s. the DOM committee's choice to
use camel-case names.}, and efforts to push the browser as a near-replacement
for the operating system\footnote{e.g. the large number of \WAPI standards for
interacting with hardware, largely adopted because of the ``Firefox OS'' and
``Chrome OS'' projects}, among many other well intentioned reasons.

Given this chaotic, unplanned, and organic development history, its worth
celebrating how successful and useful the web has been.  Its almost certainly
the worlds largest, open application platform, and despite the myriad of
security and privacy issues the web has suffered over its history, its worth
noting that in many ways the web platform has proved more secure than its
competitors.

However, to say the web has been a huge success (for application users and
developers alike) is not to say the system cannot be improved.  As this
dissertation has hopefully demonstrated, web users face a large number of
unnecessary privacy and security risks.

This dissertation aims to improve the state of web privacy and security
by applying a cost-benefit analysis to one important part of the browser,
the \WAPI, and seeing how those findings can be used to make the platform
safer for users.  Chapter~\ref{measurement} presented a technique for measuring
what parts of the \WAPI are actually being used on the web, along with the
results of applying that technique to the Alexa 10k.  Chapter~\ref{cost-benefit}
built on these measurements to systematically measure the costs and benefits
posed by each of the standards that made up the \WAPI, in order to distinguish
highly beneficial functionality from functionality that placed web users
at unnecessary, uncompensated risk.

Chapter~\ref{current-web} considered how these cost-benefit measurements could
be used to improve privacy and security on the web as it exists today, and
demonstrated the possibility for improvement through the development of a
publicly available browser extension that enforces access-controls on
the \WAPI.  Finally, Chapter~\ref{future-web} considered how these cost-benefit
measurements could be used in the development of alternative web application
system, in order to further protect web users.  Chapter~\ref{future-web} also
demonstrated the feasibility of this approach through \CDF, a system for
developing and deploying safer web applications, using commodity web browsers.

The author hopes that collectively the findings and data presented in this
dissertation can play a small role in guiding standards committees and browser
vendors in the development of a safer, more privacy preserving web.
