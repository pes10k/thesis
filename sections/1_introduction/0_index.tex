The \gls{www} is possibly the world's largest open system, allowing information
to be transferred, and individuals to interact, with a speed and ease that would
have been unimaginable only a generation ago.  This growth in popularity
has occurred alongside an explosion in the type of functionality provided to
websites, as both cause and effect.  Where websites were initially limited
to static documents of images and hyper text, websites now rival traditional
applications in terms of size and capability.  Web applications are frequently
megabytes in size, and can access graphics cards, web cameras, microphones,
perform low-level audio synthesis, and carry out parallel computation, just to
name a few examples.

Each of these features brings some plausible benefit to users, and from a
narrow point of view, web users benefit as the web gains more functionality.
More functionality means web site authors can create richer, more capable
applications. However, this point of view ignores half of the ledger.

In practice, feature growth brings both costs and benefits; it benefits users
by enabling new types of web applications that users may enjoy, but
harms users by adding risk to the platform.  Increased complexity
can harm users by expanding the user's trusted computing base (making bugs and
vulnerabilities more likely), broadening the attack surface of the platform,
and making information flows more difficult for users to understand.

Instead of providing websites with a maximal set of features, web users would
be best served by restricting what functionality websites can access,
and only allow websites to access features where the benefits outweigh the
costs. Put more casually, web browsers should only allow websites access to
functionality when the cargo is worth the freight.

This work presents an attempt to measure the costs and benefits of feature
growth in the browser, both to understand how to improve the web as it exists
today, and to explore alternate ways of deploying web applications with
an emphasis on security and privacy.  This approach of improving browser
privacy and security by restricting websites to a reduced feature set
makes it very different from most other research in the area, which focuses
primarily on either changing the implementations of a small number of features
in the browser or developing new methods for identifying implementation errors.
