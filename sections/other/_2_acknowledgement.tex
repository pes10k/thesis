\acknowledgment
I am extremely grateful to Chris Kanich, my advisor, for his guidance,
encouragement, and good humor.  Without that hat-trick, every part of this
work would be weaker, and I'd still be miserably building PHP websites
at Caribou Coffee.  A deep, sincere, mega-thanks Chris :).

I also grateful to the other members of my committee, Stephen Checkoway,
Jakob Eriksson, Damon McCoy and Venkat Venkatakrishnan, for their generous
time and help.

Thank you too, to my other collaborators. Lara Ansari,
Periwinkle Doerfler, Michael K. Reiter, Cynthia Taylor and Laura Watiker,
I'm glad and grateful I got to work forces with you.

Thanks also to the other BITSLab folks.  Even though we didn't research
together, I'm glad I could take in some of your smarts, charm and general
pleasantness though osmosis. Sara Amini, Tomas Gerlich, Mohammad Ghasemisharif,
Yanzi Jin, Mohammad Taha Khan, Timothy Merrifield, ABM Musa and Sepideh
Roghanchi, thanks for making the six-years more pleasant and fun than they
probably should have been.

Finally, thanks to the folks who have been angels to me outside of UIC, without
whom this wouldn't have gotten done. Khen Chee Leuk for being the closest thing
to a nurse (beside the actual nurses) and helping me after I goofed it
and couldn't move my arms for a bit.  Alan Yu for being sweet,
forgiving and keeping my PhD-ego level headed.  And Sam and
Molly Scranton for helping me not be such as sad-sack when I was being a doof.

Oh, and family too: Kristen, Julia, and Peter.  I guess they played some
role in all this.
